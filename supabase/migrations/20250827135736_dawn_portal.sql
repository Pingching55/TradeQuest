  # Fix Profiles RLS Policy for Team Chat

  1. Problem
    - Current profiles RLS policy only allows users to see their own profile
    - Team chat needs to display other users' names
    - Chat shows "user_b3314cbf" instead of actual usernames

  2. Solution
    - Add policy to allow team members to see each other's profiles
    - Keep existing security for non-team contexts
    - Allow profile lookup for team chat functionality

  3. Security
    - Users can still only see their own profile in general contexts
    - Team members can see basic profile info (username, full_name) of other team members
    - No sensitive information exposed
