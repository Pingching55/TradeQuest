  # Create Team Images Storage Bucket

  1. Storage Setup
    - Create 'team-images' storage bucket if it doesn't exist
    - Set up proper access policies for team members
    - Allow team members to upload and view images
    - Make bucket public for easier access

  2. Security
    - Only authenticated users can upload
    - Team members can view team images
    - Proper file size and type restrictions

  3. Testing
    - Verify bucket creation and policies
