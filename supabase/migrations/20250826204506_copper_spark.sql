/*
  # Fix Teams RLS Policies - Safe Version

  1. Problem
    - RLS policies have infinite recursion when checking team membership
    - Some policies already exist from previous migrations

  2. Solution
    - Safely drop existing policies with IF EXISTS
    - Create simplified policies without recursion
    - Use direct checks to avoid circular references

  3. Security
    - Maintain same security level
    - Users can only access their own team data
